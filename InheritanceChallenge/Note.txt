Inheritance means inherit the properties and methods of parent class by the children by using IS-A-Relationship and Has-A-Relationship.

 If there is IS-A-Relationship then use inheritance
 and if there is Has-A-Relationship then we create their object and use it

 Protected Access modifire is odten used in inheritance to allow subclass access to superclass memeber.

 subclass = new class or children
 superclass  = existing class or parent class

 By using extends keyword we inherit the properties of parent class in children class.
 
 ex: public class TwoWeeler extends Vechile {

    TwoWeeler(int noOfTires) {
        this.noOfTires = noOfTires;
    }
    
}


children ka object banane ke liye parent ka default constructor apne aap call hota hai so hame haesa ek default constructor banana hai parent class me.

TYPES OF INHERITANCE:-
1.Simple Inheritance {ParentClass <----- childClass}
2.Multi-level Inheritance{ParentClass<-----childClass1<--------childClass2}
3.Multiple Inheritance {parentClass1 and parentClass2 <-------childclass} due to dimond shape problem multiple Inheritance are not supported in Java.
4.Hierarchical Inheritance{ parentClass <--------childclass-1,childclass-2}
