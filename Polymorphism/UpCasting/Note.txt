Polymorphism => It allows different objects to respond to the same message or method call in multiple ways
There are two type in polymorphism;
1.Runtime polymorphism == Its means the behaviour of class are decided on run time
 --- Method Overriding
2.Compile-time polymorphism  == Its means we identify the behaviour of code at the compile time then we say there is compile time polymorphism in compile time JVM convert  the .java file  into .class file i.e; byte code
 ---method overloading and operator overloading.
