Method overriding occurs when a child class define their own implementation of method  or change the behaviour of method and that method already defined in parent class then we use method overriding.

Syntax:- @override <--- This is optional we use it for symbol purpose
        // method implement by child

// jiska object pass hoga uska hhe method call hoga.

It is run time polymorphism.
